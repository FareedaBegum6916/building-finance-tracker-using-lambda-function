# Building Finance Tracker Using Lambda Functions

ðŸ“š **What I Learned â€“ Scientific Computing with Python (freeCodeCamp)**

As part of my **Scientific Computing with Python** certification from freeCodeCamp, I built a terminal-based **Expense Tracker** application using core Python programming concepts. Through this project, I practiced and applied fundamental and intermediate concepts essential for scientific computing and real-world problem-solving.

## ðŸ§± Data Structures

I used **lists** and **dictionaries** to store and manage expenses in a structured way. Each expense was stored as a dictionary with `amount` and `category` keys, and all such entries were maintained in a list. This helped me understand how to organize data efficiently and retrieve it later for filtering or calculations.

## ðŸ§® Functional Programming Tools: `map()`, `filter()`, `lambda`

One of the major highlights of this project was using Pythonâ€™s functional programming tools:

- **`map()`** was used in the `total_expenses()` function to extract the `amount` field from each expense and then pass the result to `sum()` to get the total spending.

- **`filter()`** was used in the `filter_expenses_by_category()` function to return only those expenses that matched the user-provided category.

- **`lambda`** functions made the code more concise by allowing me to write one-line anonymous functions, which are especially useful when used with `map()` and `filter()`.

## ðŸ”„ Control Flow & User Interaction

I created an infinite **while** loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit. Inside this loop, I used **if-elif-else** statements to respond to user choices and execute different functionalities such as adding a new expense, viewing all expenses, or filtering by category. The loop is broken using the **break** statement when the user selects the "Exit" option.

## ðŸ’¡ Modular Programming

I split the logic into reusable functions to keep the code modular and clean. Each function performed a single responsibility (like adding an expense or filtering the list), which made the program easier to read, test, and maintain.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Overall, this project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- **Data handling** with lists and dictionaries
- Using **functional programming tools** such as `lambda`, `map()`, and `filter()`
- **User input** with loops and conditionals
- **Modular code design** for better maintainability and readability

It brought together several key Python concepts that I learned during the **Scientific Computing with Python** curriculum and gave me the confidence to build interactive CLI tools that reflect real-world use cases.
